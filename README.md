## Idea planning 
- Yelp but not limited to restuarants 
- Productivity app (google keep but better record time spent etc) 
- Forum like piazza but each group general so for anything (reddit?)
- News aggregator (only source popular news articles) 
- Stock Marget Simulator (virtual money spend on stocks, pull real time data to check stock price, sell to increase virtual money).
